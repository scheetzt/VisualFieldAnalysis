# VisualFieldAnalysis

This repository contains a set of programs used to process traced Goldmann visual fields. 
Specifically, the XML format used in the TruthMarker App (available on the App Store iPadOS). 
Example files and test cases will be provided shortly, along with documentation.

Future work:
We are currently merging these programs to make a streamlined process, consisting of four parts, 
each of which will have a program. These are QA, processing, 2D rendering and 3D rendering.

Programmatic requirements:
The majority of the programs are written in Python, and require version 3 to correctly.

Specific requirements by program:
- QA_traces.py requires PIL and pyx
- drawGVF.py requires pyx, shapely, and numpy 
- drawGVF_open_isopters.py requires pyx, shapely, and numpy
- extrap_from_I4e_text.py requires shapely 
- extrap_from_III4e_text.py requires shapely
- render3D.py requires numpy, dateutil, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, shapely, and skimage 
- add_splines.pl requires Getopt::Long (Perl)
